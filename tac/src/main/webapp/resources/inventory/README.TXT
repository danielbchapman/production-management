/**
 * The inventory classes here are a result of a maintenence refactoring. Due to the 
 * design of the classes I find that these elements need to be completely redesigned. While
 * the backend is actually rather elegant (if slightly nested) the front end results in a 
 * large number of nested forms. This isn't the best way to handle it, but it is what it is
 * right now. In short--don't expect to find explicit logical updates here. It won't be the case.
 * Much of this is basically spaghetti design from the UI standpoint and any notes I can provide are 
 * found in this document.
