Production Management Database
====================
An opensource JPA/JSF web based production management tool geared to managing touring/multi-venue theatrical productions. 

I want to extend a big thank you to The Acting Company http://www.theactingcompany.org for allowing me to open-source this project 
a few years after I left. This database was development mainly on their dime during my tenure as production manager. The goal 
of the software is to create a web-based client that allows the production staff to schedule effectively, track budgets,
contact information, inventory as well as creating detailed reports based on the needs of the production. Obviously this is geared towards 
the touring model The Acting Company used at that point in time (~2011-2012) but this can be moulded to fit nearly any theatrical process.

In particular I'd like to thank Nancy Cook and Ian Belknap (without their kindness this software would be collecting dust on a hard drive somewhere). 
I've chosen to license this under the GPL v3 so that any work done on the project is pushed back to the community.
